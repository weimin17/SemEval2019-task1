# SemEval2019-Taks1: Cross-lingual Semantic Parsing with UCCA


This Project describes the systems of the CUNY-PKU team in “[SemEval 2019 Task 1: Cross-lingual Semantic Parsing with UCCA](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/19160)”. We introduce a novel model by applying a cascaded MLP and BiLSTM model. Then, we ensemble multiple system-outputs by reparsing. In particular, we introduce a new decoding al- gorithm for building the UCCA represen- tation. Our system won the first place in one track (French-20K-Open), second places in four tracks (English-Wiki-Open, English-20K-Open, German-20K-Open, and German-20K-Closed), and third place in one track (English-20K-Closed), among all seven tracks.


In the post-evaluation stage, our improved systems are ranked first in three tracks ( French-20K-Open, English-20K-Open and English-Wiki-Open) and second in the other four tracks.
